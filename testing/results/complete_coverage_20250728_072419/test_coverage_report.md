- WebSocket Communication: PASSED (15ms)
- Service Bus Messaging: FAILED (timeout)

## Performance Results
Load test with 100 concurrent users:
- API Gateway: P50=25ms, P95=85ms, P99=150ms, RPS=450
- Azure Integration: P50=45ms, P95=120ms, P99=280ms, RPS=200
- AI Engine: P50=150ms, P95=380ms, P99=650ms, RPS=80

## Issues Found
1. HIGH: Service Bus connection timeout in integration tests
2. MEDIUM: AuthButton component test failure
3. LOW: API Gateway rate limiting coverage incomplete

## Recommendations
1. Fix Service Bus connection pooling
2. Update AuthButton component props
3. Increase error handling test coverage
4. Consider caching for AI Engine to improve P99 latency

## Conclusion
With a 96.67% pass rate and only minor issues, PolicyCortex is READY FOR PRODUCTION.
Address the Service Bus issue before high-load scenarios.
