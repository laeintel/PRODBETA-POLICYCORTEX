## ⚠️ **Current Issues & Resolution Plan**

### 🚨 **CRITICAL BLOCKERS** (High Priority)

#### 1. Patent API Endpoint Loading Issue
**Problem**: Patent-specific endpoints returning HTTP 404
**Root Cause**: Route registration failure during container startup
**Impact**: Cannot test core patent functionality
**Resolution Strategy**:
```bash
# Debug sequence
1. Check AI Engine container logs for import errors
2. Validate Python dependencies in Docker environment  
3. Test route registration in FastAPI startup sequence
4. Verify import paths for patent implementation modules
```
**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-3 hours
**Confidence**: HIGH (Likely import/configuration issue)

#### 2. Service Syntax Errors
**Problem**: 3 services failing due to Python syntax errors
**Details**:
- `notification/main.py:45` - IndentationError
- `data_processing/main.py:83` - Unterminated string literal
- `frontend` - Missing generate-config.sh script

**Resolution**:
```python
# Fix notification service
Line 45: Fix indentation in EmailService import

# Fix data processing service  
Line 83: Add missing quote to close string literal

# Fix frontend
Add missing script or update Dockerfile entrypoint
```
**Estimated Fix Time**: 1 hour total
**Confidence**: VERY HIGH (Simple syntax fixes)
