### Performance Metrics

Load test results with 100 concurrent users:

| Service | P50 | P95 | P99 | RPS |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| API Gateway | 25ms | 85ms | 150ms | 450 |
| Azure Integration | 45ms | 120ms | 280ms | 200 |
| AI Engine | 150ms | 380ms | 650ms | 80 |

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. HIGH Priority
- **Service Bus Connection Timeout**
  - Impact: Async messaging may fail under load
  - Fix: Increase connection pool size and implement retry logic

### 2. MEDIUM Priority
- **AuthButton Component Test Failure**
  - Impact: UI component may not render correctly
  - Fix: Update component props validation

### 3. LOW Priority
- **API Gateway Rate Limiting**
  - Impact: Potential for API abuse
  - Fix: Implement comprehensive rate limiting tests
