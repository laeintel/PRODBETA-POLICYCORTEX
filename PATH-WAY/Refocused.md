🎯 Current state of your UI

The Executive suite already exists and exposes key C‑suite metrics: governance ROI, risk reduction, operational efficiency, cost savings and compliance scores. It also includes deeper pages for ROI analysis, risk heat maps and board reports.

An Audit Trail page displays historical events with filters and a timeline, but still pulls from mock data and doesn’t surface tamper‑evident verification or signed evidence.

There are separate pages or menu entries for FinOps, Governance, Security & Access, Operations, DevOps, Cloud ITSM, AI Intelligence, Governance Copilot, Blockchain Audit, Quantum‑Safe and Edge Governance. In practice, many of these rely on mock data or are still experimental.

The navigation currently lands on a generic “Dashboard” or “Tactical” home rather than highlighting your most differentiated features. “Policy” as a concept is hidden under “Governance”.

Back‑end endpoints exist for predictions (/api/v1/predictions), blockchain audit (/api/v1/blockchain/audit and /api/v1/blockchain/verify), executive ROI metrics (/api/v1/executive/roi) and other features, but the UI is still wired to mock servers.

🔎 Key pain points

Too many top‑level sections create cognitive overload. There are upwards of ten menu items, many of which aren’t ready for prime time.

Mock data reliance. Critical pages (audit, predictions, ROI) use stubbed data, undermining trust.

Duplicated concepts. “Blockchain Audit” sits next to “Audit Trail” when the former is just a mechanism for the latter.

Policy buried. Policy creation, packs and enforcement aren’t surfaced as a first‑class area, even though they’re your differentiator.

Disjoint landing flow. Logging in lands the user on a tactical dashboard instead of the Executive Intelligence Dashboard where the product’s value is clearest.

Labs and Beta features clutter the nav, making it hard for new users to focus on what’s ready today.

✅ High‑impact overhaul
1. Rationalise the navigation

Move to a clean, 8‑item core navigation plus one Labs entry. Your top bar becomes:

Executive   |  Policy  |  Audit Trail  |  Predict  |  FinOps & ROI  |  Access Governance  |  Resources  |  DevSecOps  |  Settings  |  Labs ▼


Executive becomes the post‑login landing page and shows summary KPIs, cost savings, risk map, and a one‑click Generate Board Report.

Policy surfaces the control plane: a hub with coverage statistics, predicted drift, prevented violations and $ impact; a Packs library (NIST 800‑53, CIS, SOC2, HIPAA, FedRAMP); a Composer wizard; Enforcement mapping to CI/CD gates; Exceptions and Evidence.

Audit Trail absorbs “Blockchain Audit.” Replace mock rows with live calls to /api/v1/blockchain/audit; add a per‑entry Verify action that hits /api/v1/blockchain/verify?hash=…, a chain‑level verify banner (calling /api/v1/blockchain/verify), and an “Export signed evidence” download.

Predict lists upcoming misconfigurations with ETA, confidence and impact; clicking an item opens details with feature attributions and a Create Fix PR action. Pull data from /api/v1/predictions.

FinOps & ROI pulls real numbers from your executive ROI API and shows savings, anomalies and forecasts. A What‑if simulator can reuse the prediction model to show savings if a policy is enabled.

Access Governance, Resources and DevSecOps remain intact but are clearly separated. Use RBAC views and saved filters for Access Governance, inventory tables for Resources, and pipeline/gate results for DevSecOps.

The Labs menu collapses experimental pages: Copilot, Cloud ITSM, Quantum‑Safe, Edge Governance, and Blockchain Explorer. Mark them as “Labs” and remove them from search indexing until they’re backed by real APIs.

2. Showcase core value instantly

Redirect authenticated users to /executive. If they have C‑suite access, they’re exactly where they need to be; if not, the page can display a “Welcome” state with key product highlights.

Add a small “Top predictions” panel on Executive to nudge engineers toward the Predict page.

Use a FinOps card on Executive summarising quarterly savings and risk avoided, with a “View ROI board” button.

3. Replace mocks with live data

Delete or disable the mock ML server and mock backend JS; update all data fetches to call your Next.js proxies (e.g. /api/v1/executive/roi, /api/v1/predictions, /api/v1/blockchain/audit, /api/v1/blockchain/verify). Those proxies call your Rust API which already supports real data.

Add skeleton loaders and error handling. If a call fails, display an inline error and a retry button rather than freezing the UI.

Use a .env flag (e.g. NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=false) to turn off mocks globally at build time.

4. Embrace frictionless UX patterns

3 or fewer primary actions per page. On the Policy hub: New Policy, Install Pack, Run Simulation. On Audit Trail: Verify chain, Export Evidence, Refresh. On Predictions: Create Fix PR, View Details.

One-step navigation: everything is reachable within one or two clicks from the nav or the home dashboard.

Global command menu (Ctrl/⌘+K) to jump to any screen or run a quick action (“Verify chain,” “New policy,” “Generate board report”).

Drawers instead of modals: when inspecting an audit log entry or policy details, use a right‑hand drawer so users retain context.

Saved views and compact/dense modes for large tables. Let users toggle between “Comfortable” and “Compact” row heights.

Keep your semantic chips (Success/Warning/Danger/Info) but remove superficial “NEW/AI/ENHANCED” badges. Reserve “Beta” or “Labs” for genuine preview features.

5. Elevate Policy as your differentiator

Policy is your product’s control plane. Make it the second tab and give it a landing page that highlights:

Coverage (percentage of accounts/resources under policy)

Predicted drift in the next seven days

Violations prevented in the last 30/90 days

Estimated savings tied to each policy

A Composer wizard that steps through baseline, scope, parameters, enforcement, simulation (show predicted drift reduction and cost savings), and creation.

Packs to jumpstart compliance; each pack lists controls and shows its predicted impact on drift and cost.

Exceptions workflow with time‑boxed waivers, approvers and auto‑review.

🔌 Backend wiring blueprint

All the heavy lifting on the backend already exists:

Blockchain audit and verification endpoints in core/src/api/blockchain.rs provide event lists and hash verification; swap your UI mocks to these endpoints and display Merkle proof and signature status to prove tamper‑evidence.

Predictions come from a real engine at /api/v1/predictions; your Next.js route proxies to a Rust handler that can call your ML server. Instead of simulating predictions, call this API and surface the top items in the Predict page and the Executive widget.

Executive ROI metrics are available via /api/v1/executive/roi; use these to populate the ROI card on Executive and the FinOps board.

Keep a single fetch helper in your React code with no-store caching and generic error handling; use it consistently.

Remove calls to scripts/mock-ml-server.py and mock-backend.js from your pages once the real APIs are fully wired.
