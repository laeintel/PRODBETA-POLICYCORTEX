Comprehensive Codebase Analysis and Integration Review
UI Integration and Cleanup
Removing Mock Data from the UI

Several front-end components are still using hard-coded mock data intended for the demo, which should be replaced with live data from the backend:

Analytics Dashboard: The analytics metrics (API requests, developers, uptime, latency) and lists of top endpoints, developers, and error rates are currently defined as static JavaScript objects in the React component
GitHub
GitHub
. These placeholders (e.g. total API requests = 2,847,293, etc.) should be populated by calling real API endpoints. For example, the backend’s /api/v1/metrics route (FastAPI) returns a set of cross-domain metrics
GitHub
, which could feed into this dashboard instead of the hard-coded values. Removing the inline mock objects and fetching the data via an API call (with proper loading states) will ensure the dashboard reflects actual usage metrics rather than static demo numbers.

API Explorer: Currently the “API Explorer” simulates calls by waiting 1.5 seconds and then displaying a canned response from a local sampleResponse object
GitHub
. The code constructs a mockResponse with fixed headers and data, then simply JSON-stringifies it to the UI
GitHub
. To eliminate this mock behavior, the Explorer’s “Send Request” button should perform a real HTTP request (e.g. using fetch or Axios) to the selected endpoint on the running backend. This would involve reading the base URL (https://api.policycortex.com is already shown in the UI
GitHub
) and the user-provided auth token, then making the GET/POST call and showing the true response or any error messages. By wiring the Explorer to hit the actual /v1/governance/overview, /v1/violations/predictive, etc. endpoints, we ensure it’s not just a “simulation” but a functional API testing tool. (In the interim, if the backend is not fully implemented, you might point it at the FastAPI mock service for now, but the goal is to eventually call live logic.)

Webhook Configuration: The Webhooks management UI is also using an in-memory list of example webhooks initialized in React state
GitHub
. When the user adds a webhook or toggles/deletes one, it only updates this local state and does not persist anywhere. To integrate this properly, the front-end should call real webhook APIs – for example, an endpoint like GET /api/v1/webhooks to list configured webhooks, POST /api/v1/webhooks to create a new one, and perhaps PUT/PATCH to toggle or DELETE to remove. Currently, such endpoints are not evident in the FastAPI main_simple.py (it doesn’t list webhooks routes), so those backend routes may need to be created. In the meantime, to remove the mock data, you could at least label these as “demo data” or hide the feature until the backend is ready. But ideally, implementing the backend integration will allow removal of the dummy array. The “Test” button in this UI simply triggers a JavaScript alert() with a fake payload
GitHub
 – this too should be improved to call a real “send test webhook” endpoint (or at least display the result on the page rather than an alert). Removing these placeholders will make the Webhook panel truly functional.

In summary, everywhere mock or sample data is used on the UI, it should either be connected to a real API source or removed. The System Status report confirms that as of the MVP demo, the core API was in “Mock Mode” using simulated responses
GitHub
, so both the frontend and backend need to transition out of demo mode in tandem. For each UI component above, the corresponding backend functionality must be implemented so that we can fetch real data instead of using hard-coded values.

Ensuring All Interactive Elements Are Functional

Beyond data integration, we need to audit the UI for any links or buttons that currently do nothing (or lead nowhere) and fix or remove them:

Navigation Links: The top navigation menu is mostly anchored to page sections (About, Documentations, Contact) and an /api page, which is good. However, we notice an inconsistency: the mobile menu includes a “Governance” section link
GitHub
, while the desktop menu does not list Governance at all
GitHub
. This likely means the “Governance” section is intended to be part of the one-page home layout (and indeed the homepage has a <section id="governance">
GitHub
), but on desktop there’s no way to jump to it. We should add “Governance” to the desktop nav or decide to remove it from mobile for consistency. Given the home page does have a governance section, adding it to the desktop navigation (with the same scroll behavior as About/Documentations) would make that section accessible on larger screens.

“Solutions” Dropdown: In the header component, there is state for solutionsOpen and logic for closing it on outside clicks
GitHub
, but no “Solutions” menu item is actually rendered in the JSX. This appears to be leftover code for a Solutions dropdown that was never implemented in the UI. This dead code should be removed to simplify the header logic, or if a Solutions menu is needed, it should be properly implemented (i.e. add a “Solutions” item that toggles a submenu). As it stands, that state is unused UI clutter.

CTA Buttons: All call-to-action buttons and links should lead somewhere meaningful. The “REQUEST A DEMO” buttons in the header simply anchor to the Contact section (which displays contact emails), which is fine. But on the API Documentation page, the “Download SDK” buttons and “View Documentation” links for various SDKs are placeholders. They currently do nothing – e.g. the Download SDK button is a plain <button> with no click handler, and the “View Documentation” link just has href="#"
GitHub
. We must address these: if SDKs are available, those buttons should link to the actual file downloads or package URLs (or at least be disabled with a tooltip “Coming soon” if not ready). Similarly, the documentation links could point to actual docs (perhaps sections on the same page or PDF guides). If these are not yet prepared, it’s better to remove or disable these elements so they don’t mislead users. Every interactive element should have a purpose – otherwise it’s an “inefficiency” in the UX causing confusion.

Forms and Inputs: The API Explorer’s “Authorization” field, “Endpoint” selector, etc., are functional, but ensure any other forms are wired. For example, if a contact form or newsletter signup existed (it doesn’t appear there is one – the Contact page just lists emails), it would need a working submission. In our case, no immediate form issues were found aside from the webhook form being local-only, as mentioned.

Scroll/Skip Links: The homepage uses “skip links” (Skip to main content and Skip to navigation) for accessibility
GitHub
, which is excellent. However, to make them effective, the corresponding target elements must have id="main-content" and id="navigation". The <main> has an id of "main-content" already
GitHub
, but the header/nav is missing an id="navigation" attribute (the skip link references it, but the <Header> component doesn’t set that id). We should add an id="navigation" on the <header> or <nav> element so that the skip link correctly focuses the navigation landmark. This is a small fix to ensure accessibility features actually work as intended.

Conduct a thorough click-through of the entire UI in a browser, and verify that every menu item, button, and link leads to the expected destination or triggers the intended action. If any do nothing, decide whether to implement their functionality or remove them. This will eliminate any “false affordances” (UI elements that look clickable but aren’t). By cleaning up these, the app will feel much more polished.

UI Performance and Code Quality Improvements

In addition to functionality, there are a few areas to tidy up the UI code and improve performance or maintainability:

Remove Unused or Duplicate Code: Strip out any code that is no longer needed. For example, the solutionsOpen state and related menuRef in the Header can be removed if no Solutions menu is shown. Similarly, if the main repository still contains an outdated frontend/ directory (from a previous iteration of the UI) now that the Next.js site lives in policycortex-website, consider deleting the old code to avoid confusion. Redundant files (like old mock data scripts or unused components) should be pruned. This makes the codebase leaner and easier to navigate.

Optimize Images and Assets: The site uses several large image graphics (e.g. dashboard screenshots). Currently these are loaded as standard PNGs (exec-dashboard.png, etc.) with lazy loading, which is good
GitHub
. To improve load performance, especially on mobile, we should convert these images to modern formats like AVIF/WEBP and provide srcset for responsive sizing
GitHub
. The mobile UX audit explicitly recommended making the hero/feature images smaller and using width/height attributes and better formats
GitHub
. Implementing those suggestions (like adding <Image> components or at least proper <img srcset="...">) will reduce LCP time. Also ensure all <img> have descriptive alt text (which they do in our code ✅) and consider inlining critical CSS for above-the-fold content for faster first paint
GitHub
.

Efficient Event Handling: Some of our components use interval timers and effects for animations (e.g. the typewriter effect on the home hero text, the scramble text on the Contact page). We should make sure these cleanup after themselves. For instance, the scramble text effect sets a setInterval but does not clear it on component unmount – we might add a cleanup function in the useEffect to clear any ongoing intervals to prevent memory leaks or console errors if the page is left early. Likewise, throttle expensive scroll handlers if any (the Header uses a scroll listener for active section highlighting
GitHub
, which is fine as implemented). These are micro-optimizations that improve the app’s robustness.

Accessibility and Responsiveness: Continue addressing items from the UX audit. For example, ensure a proper heading hierarchy (the homepage should have one <h1> and logical <h2>/<h3> order – it looks like it does). Maintain sufficient color contrast and focus indicators on interactive elements (the design uses red hover states, but also ensure keyboard focus is visible). Make tap targets on mobile large enough (44px). The audit also suggested adding a robots.txt and sitemap.xml
GitHub
 – while not code efficiency per se, it’s part of cleanup to prepare for production. Generating a sitemap and configuring robots.txt (with no disallow for public pages and a pointer to the sitemap) will help SEO if this site is publicly accessible.

Consistent Styling and Naming: Do a pass on class names and remove any leftover utility classes or style definitions that aren’t used. Ensure components follow the same style conventions (the code appears consistent with Tailwind classes, which is good). Little things like using scroll-mt-24 on sections to offset the fixed header when scrolling via fragment links are already handled, which is a nice touch.

By addressing these UI quality items, we not only improve performance (faster loads, smoother experience) but also make the code cleaner. These improvements reduce technical debt and ensure the front-end is production-ready (not just a demo showcase).

Backend Integration and Codebase Improvements
Replacing Mock Endpoints with Real Data Logic

On the backend side, the FastAPI API Gateway service (backend/services/api_gateway/main_simple.py) is currently returning hard-coded responses for most endpoints – essentially functioning as a stub server for demo purposes
GitHub
GitHub
. To move forward, each of these endpoints needs to be backed by actual logic or database queries:

The governance overview (GET /api/v1/governance/overview) and related endpoints (predictive violations, policy validation, etc.) should fetch real data from the system. In the MVP, these were likely meant to be served by the Rust core or a database. Now is the time to implement those connections. For example, if compliance scores and violation counts are stored in PostgreSQL (the System Status doc indicates a PostgreSQL with 3 demo tenants is running
GitHub
), the FastAPI route handler can query that DB instead of returning a static JSON. If the Rust core provides an API or library functions for these, integrate those: e.g. call a Rust service (maybe via HTTP or invoke Rust code via FFI) to get the real governance overview.

The predictive models endpoints (/api/v1/predictions, /api/v1/predictions/risk-score/{id}) currently return example data
GitHub
GitHub
. These should be wired to the actual ML model or predictive engine. If the ML model is not fully ready, consider at least moving the static data to a centralized place (like a JSON file or the database) so it’s easier to update and less hard-coded in the code. Ultimately, when the ML service is live, these endpoints can call it (perhaps via an internal HTTP call or message queue). The key is to eliminate inline sample data in favor of real computations.

Similarly, metrics and correlations (/api/v1/metrics, /api/v1/correlations) and others (policy translation, approval request, etc. in main_simple.py) all need real implementations. A likely approach is to have the Rust core service implement these features (e.g. computing cross-domain correlations, handling policy translation and approval workflows) and then exposing them via an API or library. As the status report notes, the Rust core was put in mock mode due to some compilation issues
GitHub
. Those issues should be resolved now (since “previous changes” were merged), so we can run the real core service. In fact, there is a core/src/main.rs (Axum server) and a core/src/main_mock.rs – we should switch to using the real main.rs if it’s operational. Ensuring the core service runs and is hooked up (via REST, gRPC, or GraphQL) to the API Gateway will let us retire the main_simple.py stub entirely.

GraphQL Gateway: The docs referenced a GraphQL gateway with a mock resolver
GitHub
. If GraphQL is part of the architecture (perhaps to serve a UI or external API), similar treatment applies: replace any mock resolver logic with real resolvers fetching from the database or core. If GraphQL is not needed going forward (since the REST API covers the use cases), it could even be removed to reduce complexity. But if kept, it must no longer just return demo data.

In short, each API endpoint should do what its name implies, rather than returning static JSON. This may involve significant development (implementing business logic, database schema, etc.), but it’s critical for moving from a demo to a functional product. Until these are in place, the front-end integration from the earlier section cannot fully proceed (as the UI needs something real to call). It may be wise to prioritize the implementation of at least the key endpoints used by the UI (governance overview, predictive violations, metrics, webhooks, etc.), so the mock data can be removed on both sides in those areas first.

Codebase Cleanup and Best Practices

As we harden the backend, we should also clean up the repository and configuration for efficiency:

Remove Committed Virtual Environments: The repo currently has the entire .venv and .venv_local directories for the FastAPI service checked in. This is not necessary and significantly bloats the repository (with lots of third-party packages under pip’s vendor). These should be added to .gitignore and removed from version control. Developers can recreate the venv using the requirements file as needed. Keeping compiled environments out of Git will streamline cloning and avoid confusion about package versions.

Configuration Management: Right now, main_simple.py explicitly allows CORS from http://localhost:3000 (the frontend)
GitHub
. The Rust main.rs reads an ALLOWED_ORIGINS env variable and configures CORS accordingly
GitHub
GitHub
. We should unify these configurations. Ideally, have one source of truth for such settings (perhaps in a config file or environment). Since we’ll likely run the frontend on a production domain, ensure we update ALLOWED_ORIGINS to include that. Also double-check that secrets (API keys, DB creds) are pulled from environment or a secure store, not hard-coded.

Eliminate Redundant Code Paths: If we transition fully to the Rust core and perhaps use it to serve the API (Axum can serve HTTP just like FastAPI), we might not need the FastAPI api_gateway at all, or it could be slimmed down to just an API aggregation layer. Decide on one approach to avoid maintaining two parallel API implementations. As of now, the presence of both a Rust API server and a Python API server is an inefficiency. For the short term, you might keep FastAPI as a lightweight gateway that calls into the Rust library (using something like pyo3 to call Rust from Python, or just having Rust run and FastAPI proxy to it). But eventually, consolidating to one service will reduce complexity.

Database Seeding and Usage: The system status mentioned 3 demo tenants seeded in Postgres
GitHub
. Ensure the code to load and use this data is in place. If there are any one-off scripts (maybe in scripts/ directory) that were used to seed the DB, integrate that logic into either migrations or application startup for reproducibility. Remove any “delta” or outdated seed data scripts once you have a single source of truth for initial data.

Logging and Error Handling: In demo mode, errors might have been ignored or swallowed. Now, ensure that the backend has proper error handling – for instance, if a DB query fails or returns no data, the API should return an appropriate HTTP error or message instead of just a generic 200 with empty data. Logging should be set at an appropriate level (the code uses Python logging and Rust tracing – make sure these are configured for production environments to avoid verbose output or leaking sensitive info).

Testing: With changes above, update or write tests to cover the real data paths. The repository contains some smoke tests and possibly Playwright tests. These should be revised to no longer expect mock outputs. For example, any test that assumed a static compliance_score of 94.2 in the /overview response will need to either seed known data or adapt to dynamic values. Expanding the test suite (unit tests for core logic, integration tests for API endpoints) will help catch any regressions as we refactor out the mocks.

By performing this backend cleanup and implementing real logic, we’ll remove the “scaffolding” that was used to get the demo running. The code will shift into a maintainable state suitable for a production beta. The goal is that nothing in the product is “smoke and mirrors” anymore – all data and features are backed by actual code and systems. This will also build trust with stakeholders/users when they kick the tires on the system, as they won’t encounter obvious placeholders or dummy data.

Additional Efficiency and Removal of Inefficiencies

Finally, here are some catch-all items across the codebase to address any remaining inefficiencies or technical debt:

Repository Structure: Organize the repository to reflect the final architecture. If the front-end is separate (policycortex-website), make that clear, and possibly move it out of the main repo (if not already) to avoid confusion. The main repo could contain just backend services, and the website repo the Next.js app. Each should have clear README and documentation. This prevents new developers or integrators from accidentally working on the wrong code or duplicating efforts.

Documentation: As we remove mock data and change integration points, update the documentation accordingly. For example, the Quick Start guide on the API page shows example cURL commands
GitHub
GitHub
 and sample responses
GitHub
. Make sure these still hold true once the backend is live (they likely will if we implement the endpoints to return the same fields). Also, if any internal docs or the wiki refer to “using mock mode” or similar, revise them to instruct using the real mode. Up-to-date docs are an often overlooked but important part of cleanup.

Performance Budgeting: Now that real operations will occur, keep an eye on performance. The audit set some targets (e.g. <= 150KB JS, <= 1.2MB images, etc.)
GitHub
GitHub
. After removing development artifacts and optimizing assets, we should be within those budgets. Likewise, on the backend, monitor memory/CPU now that computations are real (the status listed current usage under demo conditions
GitHub
 – those will change).

Feature Flags Cleanup: The code (in the older frontend config) had feature flags for “voice assistant” and “3D” etc.
GitHub
. If those experimental features are not part of the near-term roadmap, remove or disable them. The System Status noted “Voice Assistant and Explainability hidden”
GitHub
 – if hidden, the related code can possibly be removed or at least isolated behind runtime flags turned off by default. This avoids loading code for features that users can’t even access, improving performance and reducing complexity.

Security Review: As a final note, removing mock data also means the system is handling real (potentially sensitive) data. Ensure that any debug endpoints or default credentials used during development are removed. Double-check that the API requires proper auth (the API Explorer hints at needing a Bearer token). All endpoints should enforce authentication/authorization now – an inefficiency in a security sense would be leaving an open endpoint that was okay during demo but not for real usage. Lock those down as you clean up.

Conclusion

The codebase has come a long way – the UI is visually polished and the core platform features are implemented in prototype form. The next steps are all about eliminating the scaffolding and ensuring the product is solid end-to-end. By removing mock data in the frontend and backend, hooking up actual logic and data sources, and fixing any dangling UI/UX issues (broken links, unused code, etc.), we will transition PolicyCortex from a demo-ready MVP to a robust, production-ready platform.

Addressing the items above – from making every button actually do something to replacing every hard-coded JSON with real computations – will significantly improve the quality and credibility of the system. The result will be a clean, efficient codebase that is easier to maintain and extend. As we implement these changes, we should continuously test the whole flow (both automated tests and manual use) to verify that no placeholder is left behind. With a comprehensive cleanup and integration effort, PolicyCortex will not only look the part of an AI-driven cloud governance platform, but truly operate as one.
