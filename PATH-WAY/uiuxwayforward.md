Below is an enterprise‑grade UI design spec you can hand to an AI coder. It’s grounded in your repo’s current UI and APIs, so it’s fast to implement and focuses on removing friction while showcasing your moats (predictive + tamper‑evident audit + ROI).

0) Executive summary — The product story in the first 60 seconds

What the user sees first: a clean Tactical Home with three cards (Predict → Prevent, Tamper‑Evident Audit, CFO ROI). Each card shows live numbers and a single primary action.

What they can do immediately: open an audit entry, click Verify → see Merkle proof / signature valid; open a prediction, click Create Fix PR (template PR is OK on day 1); open FinOps and see savings-to-date.

How it feels: simple, fast, keyboard‑friendly, consistent.

These are already possible with your endpoints; we’re prioritizing wiring and UX polish over net‑new scope. Your Audit Trail UI exists but runs on mock data; your predictions API and blockchain verify endpoints are implemented and ready to surface. 
 
 

1) App shell & navigation

Shell layout

Left rail (collapsible): Core nav; Labs behind a single “Labs” entry.

Top bar: Environment switcher, global search/command (⌘/Ctrl‑K), user menu.

Content area: Breadcrumbs → Page title → Primary actions → Content.

Core nav (order + labels)

Home (Tactical) → /tactical

Audit Trail → /audit (tamper‑evident first)

Predict → /ai/predictions (list + detail)

FinOps → /finops (ROI, anomalies, forecasts)

RBAC → /rbac

Resources → /resources

DevSecOps → /devsecops/pipelines

Labs menu (single collapsed entry)

Blockchain Explorer, Copilot, Quantum, Edge (migrate Blockchain to Core once fully wired).
Use a route group (labs) for noindex + visual flagging. (Your middleware already enforces auth across app pages and /api/v1/*.) 

2) Page blueprints (what to build & how it should behave)
A) Home / Tactical (/tactical)

Goal: A CFO/CISO sees value in <60s.

Hero row (3 cards):

Predict → Prevent: GET /api/v1/predictions

KPI chips: Active, ETA soon, model version, precision/recall. Primary action: View Predictions → detail page. 

Tamper‑Evident Audit: GET /api/v1/blockchain/verify

Status: Integrity OK (green) or Tampering detected (red). Primary: Open Audit Trail. 

CFO ROI: /api/v1/executive/roi (backend)

KPIs: Savings this quarter and Risk avoided. Primary: Open FinOps. (Your frontend already references FinOps/Predictions routes.) 

Secondary row: “Recent Activity” (audit timeline preview), “Open PRs from Auto‑Fix,” and “Upcoming Audits”.

B) Audit Trail (/audit)

You already have a rich Audit Trail page with filters, timeline/table views, stats — replace mocks with APIs and add Verify. 

Data sources

List: GET /api/v1/blockchain/audit

Verify entry: GET /api/v1/blockchain/verify/{hash} (per row button)

Verify chain: GET /api/v1/blockchain/verify (page banner) 
 

Top pattern

Title + subtitle

Right‑aligned actions: Real‑time toggle, Export (JSON/CSV with hashes & Merkle root), Verify Chain.

Filter bar (compact)

Search (actor, target, ip, location), Date range, Result, Risk level, Saved filters.

Overview strip (4 cards)

Total events, Failure rate, Top actor, Risk trend mini‑spark (already in page; keep). 

Data views (tabs)

Timeline (default). Keep your current timeline but add “Integrity: OK/Fail” chips on each expanded card if signature_valid && merkle_proof_valid (and a Verify button that calls /verify/{hash}). 
 

Table (virtualized for 100k+ rows). Columns: Timestamp, Actor, Action, Target, Result, Risk, Integrity (badge), Actions. Column chooser + saved views. 

Right drawer (details)

Opens on row click; shows metadata, changes (JSON diff), compliance impact pill, “View Session Events”, “View Resource”, Verify Entry (inline result). You already link to related views; preserve that. 

Empty, loading, error

Keep your skeleton loaders and empty state patterns; add retry and “clear filters” on empty. 

C) Predict (/ai/predictions)

List page

Segmented controls: All / Compliance drift / Security risk / Cost anomaly.

Cards or rows with: Prediction, ETA, Confidence, Impact, Recommendation. Primary action: Create Fix PR (stub PR ok). Source: GET /api/v1/predictions. 

Detail drawer

Feature attributions (you already return features), model version, last training, “Why this prediction” explainer, Simulate policy (dropdown) → expected $$ impact. 

D) FinOps (/finops)

Top KPIs

This month spend vs budget, Savings to date, Forecasted savings.

Anomalies panel (confidence & % overrun), and Actions taken (from PRs).

ROI board

Per‑policy $ impact (top 10), “What‑if” sim (enable control → 30/60/90‑day savings).

Wire ROI card to backend ROI endpoint; wire predictions here, too. 

E) RBAC (/rbac) & Resources (/resources)

Shared patterns

Left filter rail (cloud, account/subscription, service, tag).

Main table with saved views and bulk actions.

Right drawer: ownership, permissions graph, violations, predicted drift.

Quick actions

“Grant time‑boxed access” or “Revoke drifted role”.

“Open in DevSecOps gate” for policies as code.

F) DevSecOps (/devsecops/pipelines)

Pipelines list + Gate Result history.

Clicking a failed gate opens a drawer with fix suggestion and Create Fix PR.

3) Interaction model (no friction)

Global omnibar (⌘/Ctrl‑K): jump to pages, search actors/resources, run quick commands (“Verify chain”, “New policy from template”, “Create Fix PR”).

Toast & task pattern: all long actions go async with status toasts; never block the UI.

Drawers over modals: to preserve context.

Saved views & personal defaults: remember filters/sort/density per page.

Keyboard first: ? opens shortcuts; arrows to navigate table; Enter opens drawer; V verifies an audit entry; E exports current view.

4) Visual system (simple, sophisticated, enterprise)

Typography: Inter 14/16/20/24, mono only where it helps (hashes, JSON).

Density: default “Comfortable”, toggle “Compact” (enterprise users love it in tables).

Color: restrained neutrals; semantic status colors only (success, warning, danger, info).

Components: build on Radix primitives + Tailwind (matches your current classes) + shadcn patterns for consistency. Your pages already use Tailwind‑style tokens like bg-card, text-muted-foreground, etc. Lean into that system. 

5) Accessibility & internationalization

AA contrast, focus rings, ARIA for status chips (“Integrity OK”), semantic table headers.

All actions reachable by keyboard; announce verification results to screen readers.

Copyable hashes/IDs have explicit copy buttons (you already render a copy action in Audit). 

6) Performance & reliability

Virtualized lists for Audit / Resources (50k–100k+ rows).

Skeletons + optimistic UI for toggles and quick edits (you already show skeleton/loader patterns). 

Streaming where possible; no-store for live panels.

Auth & security headers stay enforced via your middleware (nonce+CSP, HSTS in prod). 

7) What to de‑center (so Core feels crisp)

Put Blockchain Explorer, Copilot, Quantum, Edge under one Labs menu with a “Feature preview” badge until their UIs call real endpoints (Blockchain can graduate to Core as soon as verify is wired end‑to‑end). Your validation code and API already exist — this is about wiring and UI clarity. 
 

8) What the AI coder should build first (acceptance criteria)
Milestone A — “Tamper‑evident in 10 minutes”

Audit list → live data

Replace mock generator with GET /api/v1/blockchain/audit.

Each row shows Integrity (OK/Fail/Unknown) computed by calling GET /api/v1/blockchain/verify/{hash} on demand (debounced, cached).

Chain banner uses GET /api/v1/blockchain/verify; shows time of last full verify and a Re‑verify button.

Export JSON includes hash, merkle_root, signature.
Done when: a user can verify any entry and the whole chain in‑UI. 
 

Predict widget + page

Home card and /ai/predictions consume GET /api/v1/predictions.

Detail drawer shows attributions (features) and Create Fix PR (open template PR).
Done when: predictions render with confidence/ETA and a working “Create Fix PR” link. 

FinOps ROI mini

Home ROI card wired to backend ROI endpoint; show $ this quarter + forecast.
Done when: CFO card displays numbers and link to FinOps board.

Milestone B — “Enterprise table patterns”

Virtualized table (Audit, Resources) with column chooser, saved views, density toggle, CSV/JSON export.

Right drawer detail with JSON diff (you already render changes JSON — retain that pattern). 

Milestone C — “Frictionless”

Omnibar (⌘/Ctrl‑K) with jump to pages, quick verify, search actor/resource.

Keyboard shortcuts (? help sheet).

Toasts + retry patterns standardized.

9) Component inventory & responsibilities

AppShell: TopBar, SideNav, Content, Breadcrumbs, Env Switcher.

KPI Card: title, metric, subtext, action.

FilterBar: search, selects, saved views, chip summary.

DataTable (virtualized): render prop for cells, row actions, selection, column manager.

TimelineList: icon mapping (you already map actions → icons), density toggle. 

Right Drawer: tabs (Overview, JSON, Linked), footer actions (Verify, Copy JSON).

StatusChip: success/warn/danger/info + “Integrity” variants.

PredictCard: ETA, confidence, impact, “Fix PR”.

ROIWidget: savings, forecast, time range.

10) Content & wording (enterprise tone)

Buttons: “Verify Chain”, “Verify Entry”, “Create Fix PR”, “Export Evidence (JSON)”, “Open FinOps”.

Empty states: “No events match your filters. Clear filters or adjust timeframe.”

Help text: a 1‑line “Why tamper‑evident?” linking to docs; show Merkle root & signature on hover.

11) Where this design maps to current code

Audit Trail page exists with filters, timeline/table, stats — currently uses mock data → swap in blockchain APIs and add verify chips. 
 

Predictions API route exists (/api/v1/predictions) — render on Home and Predict pages. 

Blockchain endpoints exist (/api/v1/blockchain/audit, /verify, /verify/{hash}) — back UI verification features. 
 

Auth, CSP, HSTS in middleware — keep as is; all routes except login/auth are protected. 

12) Definition of Done (for each page)

Predict: loads < 1s cached; list + detail drawer; “Fix PR” opens template PR; keyboard nav. 

Audit: chain banner + per‑row verify; export includes crypto fields; table virtualization; saved views. 

FinOps: ROI numbers render; link to detail board; forecasts visible.

RBAC/Resources: filters + drawer + bulk actions; saved views.

DevSecOps: pipeline list; gate results; detail drawer; “Fix PR”.

Optional (nice-to-have, low effort)

Recent activity widget on Home reuses your timeline card visual with 5 latest events (from blockchain audit) for consistency. 

Copy buttons for hashes, user IDs (you already have a copy action—extract into a reusable component).
