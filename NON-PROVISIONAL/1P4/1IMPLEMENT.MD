## Patent Overview and Technical Requirements

### Core Innovation Description

The Cross-Domain Governance Correlation Engine represents a fundamental breakthrough in cloud governance technology by introducing the first system capable of modeling and correlating security, compliance, identity, cost, performance, and network governance signals using typed graphs with learned embeddings. The patent describes a comprehensive solution that constructs multi-domain graphs from live provider telemetry, performs sophisticated message-passing over learned embeddings, and surfaces correlated patterns of misconfiguration or exposure spanning multiple governance domains.

The system's revolutionary approach lies in its ability to detect compound risks that emerge from the intersection of multiple governance domains. For example, the engine can identify scenarios where an over-permissioned identity role coincides with an exposed network endpoint hosting sensitive data while simultaneously incurring excessive costs due to misaligned resource allocation. This level of cross-domain correlation analysis has never been achieved in existing cloud governance solutions.

The patent specifies a novel Graph Neural Network architecture with domain-specific encoders that transform categorical and numerical node features into initial embeddings, followed by a multi-layer message passing network with graph convolution, graph attention, hierarchical pooling, and dense transformation layers. The system employs aggregation functions that combine neighbor embeddings weighted by edge importance and domain compatibility scores, with learned parameters optimized using supervised, contrastive, and reconstruction loss objectives.

### Performance and Scalability Requirements

The patent establishes specific performance benchmarks that autonomous AI agents must achieve during implementation. The system must process graphs containing 10,000 to 100,000 nodes with sub-second response times for correlation analysis operations. API endpoints must respond within 100ms for 95th percentile requests, with blast radius calculations completing within 100 milliseconds for graphs with up to 100,000 nodes.

The multi-tenant isolation mechanisms must operate with less than 1ms overhead per request, ensuring that security controls do not compromise system performance.

The system architecture must support enterprise-scale deployments with 99.99% availability, automatic failover capabilities, and the ability to maintain sub-second response times under load of 10,000 requests per second. The ingestion service must process 1 million events per day while maintaining real-time correlation updates as governance data changes.

### Multi-Tenant Isolation and Security

The patent specifies comprehensive multi-tenant isolation requirements that must be implemented at multiple system layers. Database row-level security must implement PostgreSQL policies that automatically filter queries based on tenant_id columns, prevent cross-tenant data access at the database engine level, enforce tenant context through session variables, and audit all data access attempts with tenant attribution.

Per-request tenant context management must extract tenant identity from JWT tokens or API keys, validate tenant status and subscription levels, propagate context through all service layers via thread-local storage, and enforce tenant-specific rate limits and quotas. Cryptographic segregation of object storage must use tenant-specific encryption keys managed by hardware security modules, AES-256-GCM encryption for data at rest, separate storage containers per tenant, and key rotation policies with configurable intervals.

Network isolation must be enforced through tenant-specific virtual networks or namespaces, mutual TLS with tenant-specific certificates, and API gateway enforcement of tenant boundaries.
