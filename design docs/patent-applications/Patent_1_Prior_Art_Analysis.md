Title: Prior Art Analysis — Cross-Domain Governance Correlation Engine

Problem Space
Cross-domain (policy/RBAC/network/cost/resource) correlation and impact prediction at enterprise scale with real-time responsiveness.

Representative References (illustrative)
- Cloud posture/compliance tools focusing on siloed checks (various vendors): lack typed-graph attention + temporal causality ensemble + uncertainty-aware impact.
- GNN-based IT ops research: graph embeddings but not governance-specific typed hierarchy nor ensemble significance pipeline.
- Cost anomaly and security analytics tools: domain-specific; no unified cross-domain correlation with Monte Carlo impact across governance.

Differentiators
- Typed hierarchical governance graph; attention per edge-type and abstraction layer.
- Ensemble correlation combining dependence and temporal causality with calibration and significance testing.
- Monte Carlo impact simulation over governance graph with uncertainty bands; API-backed what-if.
- Tiered caching + async concurrency sustaining ≥100k events/min with sub-second queries for typical workloads.

Risk/Response Strategy
- If general GNN correlation art is cited: emphasize domain-typed hierarchy, significance pruning, and MC impact-driven recommendations tied to governance APIs.
- If streaming causality is cited: claim combination with typed attention and dependency constraints for safe remediation.

Evidence from Implementation
- Parallel fetch + semaphore backpressure and cache tiers (see `core/src/azure_client_async.rs`, `core/src/cache.rs`).
- Graph-style risk scorer and ensemble (see `backend/services/ai_engine/ml_models/governance_models.py`).
