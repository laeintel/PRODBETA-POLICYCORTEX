Title: Prior Art Analysis â€” Unified AI-Driven Cloud Governance Platform

Landscape
- Point solutions (compliance-only, cost-only, security-only); orchestrators without AI uncertainty; optimizers without digital twin validation.

Differentiators
- Cross-domain ensemble with uncertainty; digital-twin simulation prior to remediation; Pareto optimization with constraints; saga rollback and audit.

Risk/Response Strategy
- If generic AIOps orchestration cited: emphasize governance-domain constraints, uncertainty reporting, and twin-based validation.
