Title: Machine Learning System and Method for Temporal Predictive Cloud Policy Compliance Analysis with Configuration Drift Detection and Automated Risk-Based Remediation Generation

Abstract (exactly 150 words):
A predictive compliance engine forecasts near-term policy violations and detects configuration drift using temporal analysis and representation learning. A variational autoencoder (VAE) learns normal configurations and flags drift via reconstruction error with statistical process control. Time-series decomposition (trend/seasonality/residual) feeds an ensemble of predictors (sequence models and gradient boosting) to forecast violation likelihood with uncertainty bounds via Bayesian model averaging. Motif discovery and regime change detection identify pattern shifts. A risk assessment layer applies fuzzy logic and multi-criteria decision analysis to prioritize interventions by business impact, likelihood, and effort. The engine recommends remediations using case-based reasoning and constraint programming, incorporating rollback plans and audit trails. Real-time ingestion and tiered caching support 100,000+ events per minute. Interfaces expose predictions, explanations, and recommended actions for integration with dashboards and conversational systems. Embodiments include system, method, and computer-readable medium claims.

Technical Field
Temporal ML for cloud governance; drift detection; predictive analytics; risk assessment; automated recommendations.

Detailed Description
1. Drift Detection
1.1. A VAE encodes configuration vectors; drift score = reconstruction error. Control limits are derived from moving windows and SPC (e.g., 3σ rules) with false-positive control via empirical quantiles.
1.2. Alerts are generated upon sustained excursions or pattern anomalies; suspected drift is cross-validated against policy deltas and access changes.

2. Temporal Forecasting
2.1. Series are decomposed into trend/seasonality/residual; residuals inform anomaly likelihood. An ensemble (e.g., LSTM with attention, gradient boosting, Prophet-like trend) produces violation probabilities; Bayesian averaging yields posterior mean and variance.

2.2. Mathematical Specification
Let configuration vector c_t ∈ R^d. VAE encoder q_φ(z|c_t) ~ N(μ_φ, Σ_φ), decoder p_θ(c|z). Loss: L = E_{q_φ}[||c_t − ĉ_t||_2^2] + β·KL(q_φ(z|c_t) || N(0,I)). Drift score s_t = ||c_t − ĉ_t||.
STL decomposition: x_t = T_t + S_t + R_t. Ensemble members m_j produce p(y_{t+h}=1|features) and variance v_j; Bayesian averaging yields mean and variance as in the unified platform disclosure.

3. Risk Assessment and Prioritization
3.1. Fuzzy membership functions model likelihood, impact, detectability; MCDA aggregates with business weights to a priority score. Explanations include feature attribution and historical analogs.

3.2. Fuzzy/MCDA Details
Define membership µ_L(likelihood), µ_I(impact), µ_D(detectability) with triangular/trapezoidal functions. Rule base combines (L,I,D) to risk categories; defuzzify to scalar r. MCDA aggregates r with business weights w via a weighted sum or distance to ideal point.

4. Recommendation Generation
4.1. Retrieve similar cases, adapt solutions, and solve constraints (e.g., policy coverage, dependency, maintenance windows) to produce executable plans with rollbacks and confidence levels.

4.2. Constraints and Rollback
Constraint set includes policy precedence, dependency graphs, maintenance windows, SLO/budget bounds, and approvals. Plans embed compensations and verification checks; audit trails record rationales and similar prior cases.

Performance Specifications
- 24–168 hour forecasts with AUROC ≥ 0.90 on enterprise datasets; ingestion 100k+ events/min; p99 endpoint latency ≤ 1.5s
