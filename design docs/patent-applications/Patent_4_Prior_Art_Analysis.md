Title: Prior Art Analysis â€” Predictive Policy Compliance Engine

Landscape
- Reactive compliance scanners; anomaly-only detectors; time-series predictors without governance linkage.

Differentiators
- Joint drift detection + probabilistic violation forecasting with uncertainty; fuzzy/MCDA risk; case-based + constrained recommendation with rollback.

Risk/Response Strategy
- If anomaly detectors cited: emphasize policy violation forecasting with calibrated uncertainty and prioritization integrated with remediation planning.
