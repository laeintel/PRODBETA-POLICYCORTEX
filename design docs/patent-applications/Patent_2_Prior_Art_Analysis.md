Title: Prior Art Analysis â€” Conversational Governance Intelligence System

Landscape
- General chatbots (no domain synthesis); cloud assistants without framework validation; ticketing bots without saga remediations.

Differentiators
- Governance-specialized NLU; graph dialogue state; policy synthesis to provider-native artifacts; saga orchestration with rollback; sub-2s targets with hot/warm cache policies.

Risk/Response Strategy
- If NL-to-policy prior art cited: emphasize framework-aware validation, exceptions, saga execution, and audit trails.

Implementation Artifacts
- `domain_expert.py` generation; `frontend/lib/api.ts` chat contract and caching; voice UI mapping to intents.
