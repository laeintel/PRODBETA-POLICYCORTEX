Title: Natural Language Processing System and Method for Domain-Specific Conversational Cloud Governance Management with Context-Aware Multi-Turn Dialogue and Automated Policy Synthesis

Abstract (exactly 150 words):
Disclosed is a conversational AI system specialized for cloud governance that enables multi-turn, context-aware dialogue, technical query execution, and automated policy synthesis. A transformer-based domain language model, fine-tuned on governance corpora, performs intent detection, entity extraction, and dialog act prediction. Conversation state is represented as a graph over intents, entities, and actions; a long-context mechanism preserves up to 20+ turns. The system translates user intents into executable requests to governance services and synthesizes policies from natural language requirements with validation against compliance frameworks. A workflow orchestration layer executes multi-step actions using a saga pattern, with rollback and audit trails. Client integrations provide real-time chat, voice capture, and multimodal responses. Implementations feature secure token acquisition, role-aware authorization, and hot/warm caching to achieve sub-2-second response latency. Embodiments include system, method, and computer-readable medium claims covering multi-turn dialog management, policy generation, and orchestration automation.

Technical Field
Conversational computing for cloud governance; natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue management, policy synthesis, and orchestration.

Background
Traditional governance consoles require specialized knowledge and manual execution of complex steps. Generic chatbots lack domain vocabulary, multi-turn context, or policy generation capabilities, limiting enterprise adoption. A domain-specialized conversational system can translate governance intent into validated actions with auditable outcomes.

Summary
- Domain-adapted transformer for governance NLU with intent/entity heads
- Graph-based dialogue state with history summarization and context carryover across ≥20 turns
- Policy synthesis pipeline that maps NL requirements to policy JSON with framework-aware validation and exceptions
- Orchestration with saga-based workflows, compensation handlers, and audit trails
- Multi-modal outputs (text/tables/charts) and voice interface

Implementation Mapping to Codebase
- Frontend conversation and voice: `frontend/lib/api.ts` (useConversation maintains 10-turn history, context packing), `frontend/components/VoiceInterface.tsx`
- Token acquisition for secure calls: `frontend/lib/api.ts` (MSAL-based acquireTokenSilent)
- Backend AI models and expert policy generator: `backend/services/ai_engine/ml_models/governance_models.py` and `backend/services/ai_engine/domain_expert.py` (generate_expert_policy, deep knowledge base)
- Performance envelopes and latency goals: `scripts/performance-tests.js`

Detailed Description
1. Domain-Adapted NLU
1.1. A transformer encoder with governance embeddings (providers, frameworks, resource types) performs joint intent classification and entity extraction with calibration for confidence estimation.
1.2. Continual fine-tuning on curated governance corpora (policies, standards, runbooks) yields domain-specific lexicons and entity spans (e.g., NSG rule, RBAC scope, ARM tag).

2. Dialogue Management
2.1. The system tracks conversation using a graph of states (intent nodes, entity nodes, action nodes) with edges capturing anaphora, entailment, and dependency. A short-term memory preserves the last N turns; summaries are rolled into long-term context.
2.2. Context packing logic supplies previous intents and entities to each turn (see `useConversation()`), with throttling and truncation to bound latency.

3. Policy Synthesis
3.1. NL requirement → parsing → policy template candidates → rule generation per provider → validation against framework controls → parameterization → exceptions.
3.2. In one embodiment, `generate_expert_policy()` produces Azure policy rule sets with parameters, remediation steps, exceptions, and monitoring configuration.

4. Orchestration (Saga)
4.1. Multi-step actions (e.g., create policy, assign scope, validate) are coordinated via sagas; compensation steps revert changes upon failure. Audit records capture user, intent, parameters, and outcomes with timestamps and references to model versions.

5. Security and Compliance
5.1. Role-aware authorization and token-based calls; sensitive operations require elevated scopes and confirmations; transcripts are logged with redaction.

Performance Specifications
- Sub-2s end-to-end response for common intents under 100–200 concurrent users; hot-cached lookups for metrics; no-cache for chat POSTs
- 95%+ intent accuracy on governance intents; entity F1 ≥ 0.90 for resource types and policy controls (enterprise corpus)

Exemplary Claims
Independent Claim 1 (System):
A system comprising: a domain-adapted transformer configured to perform governance intent detection and entity extraction; a dialogue state manager that preserves multi-turn context as a graph; a policy synthesis engine that converts natural language requirements into validated policy artifacts with parameters and exceptions; an orchestration layer that executes multi-step actions using a saga pattern with rollback; and interfaces to deliver multimodal responses, wherein chat requests are processed without caching and metrics requests use hot caching to achieve sub-2-second responses under typical load.

Independent Claim 2 (Method):
A method comprising: receiving a governance query; extracting intent and entities; updating a multi-turn dialogue state; translating the query into one or more executable governance actions; generating a policy artifact with validation against regulatory controls; executing the actions under role-aware authorization; and returning results with suggested next steps.

Independent Claim 3 (Computer-Readable Medium):
A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed, implement the method of Claim 2.

Dependent Claims (examples):
1. The system of Claim 1 wherein the dialogue state graph encodes anaphora and dependency edges between intents and entities.
2. The method of Claim 2 further comprising summarizing prior turns and injecting summaries into a short-term context window.
3. The system of Claim 1 wherein policy synthesis includes remediation steps and monitoring configuration with alert thresholds.
4. The system of Claim 1 wherein orchestration includes compensation handlers for partial failures with audit logging of each step.
5. The method of Claim 2 wherein token acquisition uses an OAuth client to obtain delegated scopes for governance endpoints.
6. The system of Claim 1 wherein the UI includes a voice interface that maps spoken commands to intents and triggers assessments.

Examples and Use Cases
- “Enforce encryption at rest for all storage accounts per PCI-DSS” → synthesized Azure policy with parameters and exceptions; saga assigns and validates scope.
- “Show RBAC risks for production subscriptions” → intent mapped to metrics queries; results rendered as tables and charts; follow-up question reuses entities.

Prior Art and Differentiation
Unlike generic chat assistants, the disclosed system integrates policy synthesis with framework-aware validation and saga orchestration, preserving deep multi-turn context specific to governance tasks.

Claim Strategy and Coverage
Broad system/method/CRM claims with dependent coverage for state graph, policy synthesis specifics, saga/rollback, voice modality, and caching/latency envelopes.
