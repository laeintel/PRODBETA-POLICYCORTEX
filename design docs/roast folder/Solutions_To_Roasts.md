# Solutions to the 50 Roasts (Remediation Plan)

This is a prioritized, actionable plan to remediate each adoption blocker. Sequenced for fastest enterprise viability.

1) Reproducible AI
- Deliver versioned models with training data lineage, eval harnesses, and benchmarks. Publish model cards and outcomes.

2) Real Multi‑Cloud
- Implement AWS/GCP collectors, normalize schema, and policy translation. Start with read‑only, then enforcement parity.

3) Truthful Data Modes
- Add prominent “Simulated vs Real” indicators; feature flag forced‑real for production. Block risky flows on simulated mode.

4) Harden Local Runtime
- One‑click bootstrap scripts (Win/Mac/Linux), preflight checks, and containerized dev with devcontainer/compose.

5) Env‑Driven Routing
- Replace hardcoded rewrites with config/env discovery. Add service registry or gateway.

6) Unified AuthN/AuthZ
- Standardize JWT format, scopes, and claim handling. Enforce at every API boundary. Include token rotation.

7) Tenant Isolation
- Add tenant_id to all tables, queries, and caches. Enforce row‑level policies and context propagation.

8) Durable SOR
- Postgres for actions, exceptions, violations, and audit. Versioned schemas with migrations and backups.

9) Production Orchestrator
- Introduce idempotency keys, retries, backoff, saga/compensation patterns, and state machines.

10) Honest UX
- Show preflight, impact analysis, and reversibility. Require confirmations and approvals as needed.

11) Approvals & SoD
- Configurable multi‑stage approvals, SoD rules, protected envs, and emergency break‑glass with recording.

12) Evidence Factory
- Signed evidence capture, immutable storage (WORM), and auditor‑grade reports with control mapping.

13) Tamper‑Evident Logs
- Use append‑only, hashed, chained logs (e.g., immudb/OPA bundles) with signatures and attestations.

14) Secrets Lifecycle
- Move secrets to Key Vault (and AWS/GCP equivalents), enable rotation, and use workload identity.

15) Secret Boundary Checks
- Redact sensitive values in logs, add static checks to block bundling keys to clients.

16) Accessibility
- Implement WCAG 2.1 AA: focus traps, ARIA roles, contrast, keyboard nav; add automated a11y tests.

17) i18n
- Localize strings; use ICU message format; load language packs per tenant.

18) UI Scale
- Virtualized tables, server‑side paging, cursor‑based pagination, query caching.

19) Search/Filters
- Faceted search with saved views and scoped permissions; query builder with presets.

20) Offline/Conflicts
- Optimistic concurrency control (ETags), offline queues with reconciliation, conflict UI.

21) Observability
- OpenTelemetry tracing + metrics + logs across all services; dashboards for RED/USE and business KPIs.

22) SLOs & Error Budgets
- Define SLOs per endpoint; alert on SLI breaches; error budget policies for release gating.

23) DR Strategy
- Backups, PITR, cross‑region replicas; document RPO/RTO and run restore drills quarterly.

24) Data Retention
- Configurable retention/TTL, legal holds, and purge flows with audit.

25) Control Framework Mapping
- Map features to SOC2/ISO/NIST; export auditor packages with evidence links and control status.

26) Policy Engine Depth
- Build assignment graph, inheritance, parameter resolution, and effect semantics; parity with Azure/GCP/AWS.

27) Enforcement Path
- Integrate with Azure Policy/Bicep/Terraform and GCP/AWS equivalents; drift detection + auto‑remediation.

28) IAM Graph
- Build identity/privilege graph, detect attack paths, and recommend least‑privilege fixes; support PIM.

29) FinOps Foundations
- Ingest CURs/billing exports, model unit economics, align with FOCUS standard, show RI/SP planning.

30) Testing
- CI with unit/e2e/load tests; synthetic probes; test data fixtures; contract tests for APIs.

31) Threat Modeling
- STRIDE/LINDDUN per service; mitigations tracked; security reviews on each release.

32) Supply Chain Security
- SBOM generation (Syft), CVE scanning (Grype), provenance (SLSA), and dependency update policies.

33) Operability
- Helm charts, Kustomize overlays, runbooks, incident playbooks, and upgrade guides.

34) Migration/Import
- Importers for policies/evidence/exceptions; mapping tools; migration dry‑runs.

35) Pricing & ROI
- Publish pricing tiers, usage‑based options, ROI calculators based on savings and risk reduction.

36) True Multi‑Cloud Messaging
- Neutral domain model; parity features across clouds; case studies demonstrating cross‑cloud value.

37) From IP to Product
- Translate patents into shipped, measured features with benchmarks and case studies.

38) Documentation
- Developer/operator docs, architecture diagrams, SLAs, FAQs; in‑product help and tooltips.

39) Extension Model
- Plugin framework with events and stable APIs; marketplace for actions, collectors, and policies.

40) Schema Versioning
- Semantic versioning of APIs/schemas; migration guides; backward‑compat layers.

41) Event‑Driven Architecture
- Introduce event bus (Kafka/Service Bus), define contracts, publish domain events; build consumers.

42) Performance Engineering
- Load and soak testing; performance budgets; profiling; auto‑scaling policies.

43) Privacy/Residency
- Data flow maps, DPAs, field‑level controls, residency options per tenant/region.

44) UX Coherence
- Information architecture pass, task‑oriented navigation, consistent drill‑downs and breadcrumbs.

45) RBAC Enforcement
- Policy‑based access control with fine‑grained permissions; ABAC where needed; default‑deny.

46) Exceptions Lifecycle
- Time‑boxed exceptions with re‑certification, evidence linking, and automated expiry.

47) Change Management
- Integrate with CAB/RFC tools (ServiceNow/JSM); freeze windows; change calendars; approval gates.

48) References & Community
- Design partners, lighthouse customers, public references, and community Slack/forum.

49) Positioning & Messaging
- Narrow to high‑value use cases per buyer persona; measurable outcomes and proof points.

50) Culture of Evidence
- Replace claims with proof: metrics, tests, audits, and case studies. Make trust earned and verifiable.
