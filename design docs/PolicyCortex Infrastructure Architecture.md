## High-Level Architecture Overview

### System Architecture Principles

The PolicyCortex platform architecture is built upon several foundational principles that guide all design decisions and technology selections. These principles ensure the platform can scale effectively, maintain security standards, and deliver consistent performance across diverse deployment scenarios.

**Cloud-Native Design Philosophy**
The architecture embraces cloud-native principles from the ground up, utilizing containerization, microservices, and declarative APIs to achieve maximum portability and scalability. Every component is designed to leverage cloud platform capabilities while avoiding vendor lock-in through standardized interfaces and abstraction layers. The platform utilizes container orchestration for deployment management, service mesh for communication security, and cloud-native storage solutions for data persistence.

**Microservices Architecture Pattern**
The platform implements a comprehensive microservices architecture where each service has a single responsibility and communicates through well-defined APIs. This approach enables independent scaling, deployment, and development of individual components while maintaining system cohesion through standardized communication protocols. Each microservice is designed with its own data store, eliminating shared database anti-patterns and enabling true service autonomy.

**Event-Driven Communication Model**
The architecture leverages event-driven patterns for asynchronous communication between services, enabling loose coupling and improved system resilience. Events are used for data synchronization, workflow orchestration, and real-time notifications, creating a responsive system that can handle varying load patterns effectively. The event-driven approach also enables audit trails, replay capabilities, and eventual consistency across distributed components.

**Security-First Design Approach**
Security considerations are embedded throughout the architecture rather than being added as an afterthought. The platform implements defense-in-depth strategies with multiple security layers, zero-trust networking principles, and comprehensive audit logging. All communications are encrypted, access is authenticated and authorized at multiple levels, and sensitive data is protected through encryption at rest and in transit.

### Core Infrastructure Components

**Container Orchestration Layer**
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) serves as the foundation for container orchestration, providing automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The AKS cluster is configured with multiple node pools to support different workload types, including general-purpose compute nodes for standard services, GPU-enabled nodes for AI/ML workloads, and memory-optimized nodes for data processing tasks.

The Kubernetes configuration includes custom resource definitions for PolicyCortex-specific resources, operators for automated management tasks, and comprehensive RBAC policies for security. The cluster utilizes Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) for advanced networking capabilities and integrates with Azure Active Directory for identity management.

**Service Mesh Infrastructure**
Istio service mesh provides secure service-to-service communication, traffic management, and observability across the microservices architecture. The service mesh implements mutual TLS for all inter-service communication, provides circuit breaker patterns for resilience, and enables sophisticated traffic routing for blue-green deployments and canary releases.

The service mesh configuration includes custom policies for PolicyCortex services, integration with external certificate authorities for TLS management, and comprehensive telemetry collection for monitoring and debugging. Traffic policies are defined declaratively and can be updated without service restarts, enabling dynamic traffic management.

The gateway is configured with custom rules for PolicyCortex API patterns, rate limiting policies for different user tiers, and integration with Azure Front Door for global load balancing.

The load balancing strategy includes health checks for all backend services, automatic failover capabilities, and geographic traffic distribution for optimal performance. The gateway also implements API versioning, request transformation, and response caching to optimize client interactions.

**Data Storage Architecture**
The data storage layer utilizes a polyglot persistence approach with different storage technologies optimized for specific use cases. Azure SQL Database provides ACID compliance for transactional data, Azure Cosmos DB offers global distribution for document storage, and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 handles large-scale analytics data.

Each storage system is configured with appropriate backup strategies, encryption settings, and access controls. The data architecture includes data lifecycle management policies, automated backup verification, and cross-region replication for disaster recovery scenarios.
