# PolicyCortex – Out-of-this-World Governance Autopilot

Version: 1.0 (Living Document)
Owner: Architecture Team
Last updated: {{today}}

## Executive Summary

PolicyCortex will become the autonomous, explainable, multi-cloud governance autopilot. It delivers continuous, provably safe, closed-loop control across cost (FinOps), policy & compliance, RBAC/permissions, network exposure, and resource lifecycle — through a beautiful UI and conversational/voice AI. The platform will generate and enforce policies, predict risks, remediate issues, and produce audit-grade evidence packs — all while optimizing spend.

Key value outcomes (12 months):
- 20–40% reduction in monthly cloud spend via autopilot (rightsizing, commitments, idle cleanup)
- 70–90% reduction in critical misconfigurations; MTTR shrinks from days to minutes
- 95%+ continuous control pass rate; 80% faster audit close cycles
- Operator productivity +60–80%; policy and remediation tickets largely automated

Design tenets:
- Safety-first action orchestration (dry-run, approvals, blast-radius guards, rollback, audit)
- Evidence and explainability (“show your work”) for every recommendation and action
- Digital twin and what‑if simulation before change
- Multi-cloud native with cross-provider equivalence
- Extensible via plugin SDK and policy packs
