# 1. Product Vision & KPIs

This document captures the product vision, target users, core use cases, outcome KPIs, guardrails, and competitive edge for PolicyCortex.

## Vision
A safe, autonomous, multi‑cloud governance autopilot that continuously optimizes cost, enforces compliant policy, secures identities and networks, and produces audit‑grade evidence — all explainable and controllable via natural language.

## Target Users
- Cloud Platform Teams (SRE/DevOps)
- Security & Compliance (CISO, GRC)
- Finance/FinOps
- App Owners / Business Units

## Core Use Cases
- Continuous compliance enforcement with explainable AI
- FinOps autopilot (commitments, rightsizing, idle cleanup, anomaly defense)
- Exposure graph: RBAC + network misconfig → data risk paths and one‑click mitigations
- Policy Studio: NL → policy‑as‑code across clouds with equivalence proofs
- Evidence Factory: automated artifacts for SOC2/ISO/PCI/HIPAA/FedRAMP

## Outcome KPIs (12 months)
- Cost reduction: 20–40% of monthly cloud spend
- Compliance: 95%+ control pass rate; <5% false positives
- Security: 70–90% fewer critical exposures; MTTR < 30 minutes (P1)
- Audit: 80% faster close; <5 hours to produce evidence pack
- Productivity: 60–80% fewer manual tickets related to policy/finops/security
- NPS > 60; Time‑to‑Value < 1 day (guided onboarding)

## Guardrails & Principles
- Safety first: dry‑run, approvals, rollback, blast‑radius guards
- Evidence & explainability for every decision/action
- Privacy & least privilege; no long‑lived wide credentials
- Multi‑cloud by default; provider‑specific excellence
- Extensibility through plugins and policy packs

## Competitive Edge
- Closed‑loop governance (detect→decide→act→evidence) in one platform
- Cross‑cloud equivalence and proofs
- Digital twin simulations for policy/resource changes
- Auditor‑ready evidence as a first‑class product
