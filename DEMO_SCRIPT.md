## Demo Script

### 1. **Opening (1 min)**

**Navigate to**: https://ca-cortex-frontend-dev.agreeableocean-dbcff600.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io

**Say**: 
> "Welcome to PolicyCortex v2, an AI-powered Azure governance platform with four patented technologies. Today I'll demonstrate how we're transforming cloud governance with real-time AI insights and predictive analytics."

**Note**: Frontend may take 5-7 seconds to load initially (cold start)

---

### 2. **Dashboard Overview (3 mins)**

**URL**: `/dashboard` (or click "Get Started" â†’ "Go to Dashboard")

**Highlight**:
- Unified governance metrics across all domains
- Real-time compliance rate: 85.5%
- Cost optimization: $7,000 in savings identified
- Active threat monitoring: 5 blocked attempts

**Say**:
> "Our unified dashboard aggregates data from policies, RBAC, costs, network, and resources into a single pane of glass. This is Patent #1 - our Cross-Domain Governance Correlation Engine."

**Click on**: Any metric card to show it's interactive

---

### 3. **Policy Management Deep Dive (4 mins)**

**Navigate to**: Policies tab (or `/policies`)

**Show**:
1. Policy categories in sidebar
2. Compliance status indicators
3. Click on "Security" category

**Say**:
> "We currently monitor 15 policies with 12 active and 3 violations. Our AI predicts compliance drift before it happens with 92.3% accuracy - this is Patent #2, our Predictive Compliance Engine."

**Demonstrate**:
- Hover over a policy to show details
- Point out the "AI Prediction" badge on policies
- Show automated remediation options (don't click execute)

---

### 4. **RBAC & Anomaly Detection (3 mins)**

**Navigate to**: RBAC tab (or `/rbac`)

**Highlight**:
- 150 users, 25 roles monitored
- Risk score: 3.2 (low risk)
- 1 anomaly detected

**Say**:
> "Our AI continuously monitors role assignments and detects anomalous access patterns. The system identified 1 unusual permission grant that warrants review."

**Show**:
- Privileged accounts view
- Service principals monitoring
- Access review recommendations

---

### 5. **Cost Optimization (3 mins)**

**Navigate to**: Costs tab (or `/costs`)

**Display**:
- Current spend: $125,000
- Predicted spend: $118,000
- Savings identified: $7,000

**Say**:
> "Our AI analyzes spending patterns and automatically identifies optimization opportunities. We're predicting a $7,000 reduction in next month's spend through right-sizing and reserved instance recommendations."

**Point out**:
- Trend graphs (if visible)
- Department breakdown
- Optimization recommendations

---

### 6. **AI Conversational Interface (2 mins)**

**Navigate to**: AI Expert or Chat tab (or `/ai-expert`)

**Demo Query** (type but don't submit if not connected):
> "What are my top 3 compliance risks this month?"

**Say**:
> "Patent #3 is our Conversational Governance Intelligence. Users can query the system in natural language and get instant insights. This democratizes governance data across your organization."

---

### 7. **Technical Architecture (2 mins)**

**Stay on current page**

**Explain**:
> "PolicyCortex v2 is built with cutting-edge technology:
> - Rust backend for sub-millisecond response times
> - Next.js 14 with server components
> - GraphQL federation for unified API
> - WebAssembly edge functions for distributed processing
> - Post-quantum cryptography for future-proof security"

**Open DevTools** (F12) â†’ Network tab
**Refresh page** and show:
- API response times (typically <100ms)
- GraphQL queries being federated

---

### 8. **Patent Summary & Value Proposition (2 mins)**

**Return to Dashboard**

**Summarize**:
> "PolicyCortex v2's four patented technologies provide:
> 
> 1. **Unified Platform** - Single source of truth for all governance
> 2. **Predictive Compliance** - Prevent violations before they occur  
> 3. **Conversational AI** - Natural language governance queries
> 4. **Cross-Domain Correlation** - Identify hidden patterns across services
> 
> This translates to 60% reduction in compliance violations, 40% faster incident response, and 25% cost savings on average."

---

### 9. **Closing & Q&A (2 mins)**

**Say**:
> "PolicyCortex v2 is currently in preview with select enterprise customers. We're seeing exceptional results in reducing compliance burden while improving security posture."

**Show** (if asked):
- API Documentation: `/api/v1/metrics` endpoint
- Health monitoring: `/health` endpoint
- Deployment model: Container Apps on Azure

## Backup Responses for Common Questions

**Q: Is this using real data?**
> "For this demo, we're using simulated data to ensure security. The platform seamlessly switches between simulated and real data based on configuration."

**Q: How does authentication work?**
> "We integrate with Azure AD for enterprise SSO. Full RBAC and MFA support are built-in."

**Q: Can it write changes to Azure?**
> "Yes, with proper approvals. The platform can execute remediation actions, but we require human approval for destructive operations."

**Q: What about multi-cloud?**
> "Currently focused on Azure, but the architecture supports AWS and GCP adapters planned for Q2 2025."

**Q: Pricing model?**
> "Enterprise licensing based on resources monitored, starting at $50K/year for up to 1000 resources."

## Emergency Fallbacks

If frontend is slow/unresponsive:
```bash
# Show API directly
curl https://ca-cortex-core-dev.agreeableocean-dbcff600.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/api/v1/metrics | jq
```

If GraphQL not working:
> "Our GraphQL federation layer is being updated, but the core REST APIs are fully operational as you can see."

If authentication screen appears:
> "The platform integrates with your existing Azure AD. For demo purposes, we can proceed without authentication."
