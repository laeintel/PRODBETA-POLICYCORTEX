# Prediction Prompt Template

You are an AI governance expert analyzing Azure policy compliance for tenant: {{tenant}}.

## Context
- Tenant ID: {{tenant}}
- Control Family: {{control_family}}
- Time Window: {{time_window}}
- Historical Violations: {{violation_history}}
- Current Resource Count: {{resource_count}}

## Task
Analyze the provided Azure resource configuration and predict:
1. Likelihood of policy violations in the next {{prediction_window}} hours
2. Specific resources at highest risk
3. Root causes driving the predicted violations
4. Confidence level (0-100%) for each prediction

## Input Data
```json
{{resource_data}}
```

## Historical Patterns
```json
{{historical_patterns}}
```

## Required Output Format
Provide predictions in the following JSON structure:
```json
{
  "predictions": [
    {
      "resource_id": "string",
      "violation_type": "string",
      "probability": 0.0-1.0,
      "eta_hours": number,
      "confidence": 0-100,
      "root_causes": ["string"],
      "feature_importance": {
        "feature_name": weight
      }
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "high_risk_count": number,
    "mean_time_to_violation": number,
    "recommended_actions": ["string"]
  }
}
```

## Constraints
- Focus on {{control_family}} compliance requirements
- Consider tenant-specific policies: {{tenant_policies}}
- Apply ML model threshold: {{confidence_threshold}}%
- Maximum prediction window: {{max_window}} hours

## Patent Context
This prediction leverages Patent #4: Predictive Policy Compliance Engine
- Ensemble model with Isolation Forest (40%), LSTM (30%), Autoencoder (30%)
- SHAP explainability for feature importance
- <100ms inference latency requirement
