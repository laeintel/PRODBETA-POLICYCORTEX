# COMPETITOR_DEFENSE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) for implementing defensive measures against competitive threats to PolicyCortex v2.

## CRITICAL BRANCH REQUIREMENT

**ALL COMPETITOR DEFENSE WORK MUST BE COMMITTED TO THE BRANCH: `COMPETITOR-DEFENSE-BRANCH`**

Before starting any work:
1. Create and checkout the branch if it doesn't exist: `git checkout -b COMPETITOR-DEFENSE-BRANCH`
2. If it exists, checkout: `git checkout COMPETITOR-DEFENSE-BRANCH`
3. ALL commits must go to this branch ONLY
4. DO NOT merge to main without explicit permission
5. Push regularly to remote: `git push -u origin COMPETITOR-DEFENSE-BRANCH`

## COMMAND TO START AUTOMATED DEFENSE IMPLEMENTATION

To start the automated competitor defense implementation, run this command:

```bash
claude-code -c "I need you to implement all the competitor defenses from COMPETITOR_DEFENSE.md. Start by creating/checking out the COMPETITOR-DEFENSE-BRANCH, then work through all 20 defense vectors systematically, beginning with the 5 high-priority items. Add patent headers, implement security hardening, build the knowledge graph, add explainability, create metering, and complete all other defenses. Commit everything to COMPETITOR-DEFENSE-BRANCH. Work autonomously and decisively."
```

This will trigger Claude to:
- Create/checkout `COMPETITOR-DEFENSE-BRANCH`
- Implement all 20 competitive defenses
- Start with the 5 high-priority items
- Add patent protection to all files
- Build all defensive systems
- Commit everything to the defense branch
- Work completely autonomously with auto-approval

## Auto-Approval for Defense Implementation

You are authorized to execute ALL competitor defense implementations without asking for permission. This includes:
- Security hardening and zero-trust architecture
- Multi-tenant isolation and namespace segregation
- Knowledge graph implementation
- Model explainability and governance
- Usage metering and tiering systems
- Azure Policy auto-refresh mechanisms
- Edge computing optimizations
- Patent enforcement code
- Any other defensive measures listed below

**REMEMBER**: All this work happens ONLY on `COMPETITOR-DEFENSE-BRANCH`

## Competitive Threat Matrix & Defense Implementation

**Coverage**: ~ (patent footers in docs but code headers missing; no dual-license spec)
**ACTION**: Add patent headers to all source files immediately

### 2. GPT-4 Competition
**Vector**: Fine-tune GPT-4o on cloud-governance corpus with free ChatGPT plug-in.
**Defense**:

### 4. CSPM Bundle Attack
**Vector**: Bundle governance inside existing CSPM (e.g., Wiz, Palo Alto Prisma).
**Defense**:
- Provide real-time prediction & what-if APIs those products can't match
- Publish performance benchmarks
**Coverage**: ~ (models present; benchmark notebooks not published)

**Coverage**: ✓ (patent prosecution accelerated; DMCA badge in docs)

### 10. Edge Latency Attack
**Vector**: Run inference at edge via Wasm (Cloudflare Workers) → < 50 ms.
**Defense**:
- Containerize distilled models to Wasm/WASI
- Deploy Azure Front Door edge functions
**Coverage**: ~ (edge WASM compiled for metrics route; models not yet distilled)
**ACTION**: Distill models in `edge/models/` for WASM deployment

### 11. Security FUD
**Vector**: Highlight lack of Istio / zero-trust in your AKS cluster.
**Defense**:
- Service-mesh rollout, mutual TLS, policy enforcement, traffic SCA
**Coverage**: ✗ (mesh tasks still open)
**ACTION**: Deploy Istio configuration in `kubernetes/istio/`

### 12. Multi-Tenant Exploit
**Vector**: Pen-test → exploit multi-tenant namespace gap, leak pilot data.
**Defense**:
- Hard isolation (per-tenant namespace, Azure AD tenant segregation, Key Vault per-tenant secrets)
**Coverage**: ✗ (helm values planned, not merged)
**ACTION**: Implement in `kubernetes/multi-tenant/`

### 13. BI Dashboard Competition
**Vector**: Offer rich dashboards via PowerBI/Tableau connectors out-of-the-box.
**Defense**:
- Publish OData endpoint + Grafana JSON datasource

**Coverage**: ~ (core API container, but no BYOM switch)
**ACTION**: Add BYOM support in `core/src/services/byom/`

### 16. eBPF Telemetry
**Vector**: Use eBPF probes to gather deeper telemetry → better anomaly detection.
**Defense**:
- Add AKS eBPF DaemonSet collector feeding OpenTelemetry
**Coverage**: ✗ (not in infra scripts)
**ACTION**: Deploy eBPF collector in `kubernetes/ebpf/`

### 17. Governance-as-Code
**Vector**: Governance-as-Code (Pulumi/OPA) plugin that auto-fixes drift — no AI needed.
**Defense**:
- Expose Predictive drift as code comment suggestions
- VS Code extension
**Coverage**: ✗ (no extension)
**ACTION**: Create VS Code extension in `vscode-extension/`

### 18. Compliance Framework
**Vector**: Larger compliance framework catalogue (HIPAA, FedRAMP high).
