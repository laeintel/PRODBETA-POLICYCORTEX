3. Assess risk and impact
4. Track approval status

## üìä Dashboards

### ITSM Dashboard
The main ITSM dashboard provides:
- **Infrastructure Health Score**: Overall health of your cloud infrastructure
- **Resource Distribution**: Resources by cloud provider and type
- **Cost Analysis**: Current spend and optimization opportunities
- **Active Issues**: Incidents, changes, and problems
- **Service Health**: Status of critical services

### Resource States Widget
Visual representation of resource states:
- Green: Healthy running resources
