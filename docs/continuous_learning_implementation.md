# Continuous Learning System Implementation

## Overview
The PolicyCortex platform now includes a comprehensive continuous learning system that automatically learns from application errors and external technical sources to improve over time.

## Key Features

### 1. **Adam Optimizer with Warmup and Decay**
- Custom `AdamOptimizerWithWarmup` class implementing:
  - Learning rate warmup for first 1000 steps
  - Exponential decay after warmup phase
  - Gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients
  - AdamW with weight decay for regularization

### 2. **Transformer-based Error Learning Model**
- Neural network architecture with:
  - Token embeddings (vocab_size Ã— 512 dimensions)
  - Domain-specific embeddings (cloud, network, security)
  - Severity embeddings (low to emergency)
  - Positional encoding for sequence understanding
  - 6-layer transformer encoder with 8 attention heads
  - Multi-task learning heads for classification, solution generation, and severity prediction

### 3. **Technical Data Crawler**
- Automatically fetches error patterns from:
  - **Stack Overflow**: Error-related questions with specific tags
  - **Reddit**: Technical subreddits (r/devops, r/aws, r/azure, etc.)
  - **GitHub**: Bug reports from major repositories
  - **Hacker News**: Top technical stories (future implementation)

### 4. **Continuous Learning Loop**
- Runs hourly to:
  - Collect errors from multiple sources
  - Train the model on new error patterns
  - Save checkpoints periodically
  - Update learning metrics

### 5. **Error Learning Middleware**
- Automatically captures application errors
- Batches errors for efficient processing
- Classifies errors by severity and domain
- Provides real-time AI predictions for error solutions
