## Production Beta Gap Analysis

### 🔄 30-Day Implementation Plan

#### Week 1-2: Security Hardening
- [ ] Zero-trust service mesh implementation
- [ ] mTLS between all services
- [ ] Per-tenant namespace isolation
- [ ] Network policies enforcement

#### Week 2-3: Knowledge Graph
- [ ] Persistent graph database (Neo4j/Neptune)
- [ ] ETL pipeline (≤15 min latency)
- [ ] Resource relationship mapping
- [ ] Graph visualization UI

#### Week 3-4: ML/AI Enhancement
- [ ] SHAP/Captum sidecar deployment
- [ ] Drift detection implementation
- [ ] Auto-retrain pipeline
- [ ] Real-time explainability

#### Week 4-5: Commercialization
- [ ] Usage metering middleware
- [ ] Per-tenant quota enforcement
- [ ] Billing event emission
- [ ] Tiered plan enforcement

#### Week 5-6: Azure Integration
- [ ] Azure API auto-refresh
- [ ] Policy change detection
- [ ] Defender for Cloud integration
- [ ] SOC 2 evidence generation

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| GraphQL nulls | UI breaks | Mock resolver + guards | ✅ Resolved |
| Cold start latency | Poor demo | Pre-warm scripts | ✅ Resolved |
| Missing OpenAI key | No chat | Demo mode responses | ✅ Resolved |
| Core API issues | No data | Mock responses | ✅ Resolved |
| CI/CD flakiness | Build failures | Retry logic + smoke tests | ✅ Resolved |

## Deployment Readiness

### Demo Environment
- **Status**: ✅ Ready
- **Access**: http://localhost:3000
- **Data**: 3 tenants, 5 policies, sample resources
- **Fallbacks**: All services have demo mode

### Production Beta (Azure)
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Azure subscription configured
  - OIDC federation for GitHub Actions
  - Container registry access
  - Managed identity setup

## Key Metrics

### Demo Performance
- **Startup Time**: <30 seconds
- **Page Load**: <2 seconds
- **API Response**: <100ms (mock mode)
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB
- **CPU Usage**: <10% idle

### Production Targets
