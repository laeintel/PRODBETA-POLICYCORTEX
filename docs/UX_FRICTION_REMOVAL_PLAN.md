## CRITICAL FRICTION POINTS TO REMOVE

### 1. Navigation Nightmare (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Current State**: 
- 3 competing navigation systems
- 200+ menu items
- Users can't find anything

**Fix**: 
```
OLD: 200+ menu items â†’ NEW: 5 primary sections
â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard (immediate value)
â”œâ”€â”€ Governance (policies, compliance, risk)
â”œâ”€â”€ Operations (resources, monitoring)
â”œâ”€â”€ AI Intelligence (your patents!)
â””â”€â”€ Settings
```

### 2. Page Sprawl Disease
**Current State**: 
- 120+ individual pages
- 11 cost pages doing the same thing
- 12 security pages with overlapping features

**Fix**: 
- Consolidate to **10 unified dashboards**
- Each dashboard replaces 10-15 pages
- **91% page reduction**

### 3. Hidden Value Proposition
**Current State**: 
- Your 4 patented AI features are buried
- Users never discover what makes you unique

**Fix**: 
- **AI Intelligence** as primary navigation item
- Patent features get dedicated, prominent section
- AI assistant button always visible

### 4. Overwhelming First Experience
**Current State**: 
- Login page with pointless animations
- No clear starting point
- Information overload immediately

**Fix**: 
- Simple login: One button, no friction
- Dashboard shows 5 actionable items MAX
- Guided setup wizard for new users
